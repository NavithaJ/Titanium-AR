#Titanium-AR#
This code spawned from some basic experiments I've been doing with augmented reality on Titanium Mobile over iOS.

Here I provide a sample Titanium Mobile project that shows some very basic geo-AR functionality where text labels representing actual points of interest are correctly overlaid on a camera view.

The code works perfectly in the iPhone simulator, but it still has some problems I didn't have time to address, when executed on the device.

Originally I've been posting it on the Titanium Q&A forum:

It turns out that Appcelerator guys refurbished it and included some parts of it in their super-cool ARti sample AR app (wich works also on the real device):

I'm planning to turn this into a more manageable JS library when I'll get some time to work on it.
